# Boot Animation Switcher for TECNO CX Air

## Description

All the real and official three versions of WatchDogs boot animation and some other cool boot animations purely extracted from their source for TECNO Camon CX Air.

Changes the bootanimation animation and shutanimation to watchdogs and some other cool boot animations with the one you want from all the available boot animations included in this module.

You can select between all the three version of watchdogs boot animation using your volume key during installation. As simple as that!

## Can I request another cool boot or shut animation ?

Generally No. As the name suggested it is only a swithcher for watchdogs boot and shut anination. so you can't request another boot or shut animation because it makes the module size too big than this but you can contact me using my Telegram account below if you have any issue or another adjusted boot animations only for TECNO CX Air. For the future I will try to add ability to install animations placed in a specific folder in your phones internal storage.

## What can I do if I want to change my choice ?

If you want to change your choice again flash the module twice from TWRP or Magisk Manager then module becomes uninstalled in the first flash and you can choice again with the second flash.

## Why you make the module device specific ?

Because all the animations included in this module are adjusted to fit the screen size and resolution of TECNO CX Air. So it doesn't fit with other devices resolution and screen size.

## How to Uninstall ?

If you want to uninstall the module disable it from the Magisk Manager app or reflash the module again whether in TWRP or Magisk Manager.
